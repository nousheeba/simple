<h2>Everyone human wants to live a beautiful life and still they don't know what is the meaning of life.According to some people life is love, or life
is something that can't be described but</h2> <h1> life is meaning, Meaning to live. </h1> <h2>If someone doesn't have a meaning to life he doesn't live. That 
person is a hollow body with no purpose of life. If someone losts his meaning to live he simply losts his soul. When a person is born he 
gets his meaning to live but he has to find it. Some people find it right away but for some it takes a lot a time, in that time many people even
give up finding their motive to live, they are just like prisoner trapped in a prison , who just has to follow the rules and work from 9 to 5
without even a proper food and no breaks. These people find it easy to work like a prisoner, rather then working hard for a short  
period of time to achieve their goal. At last these type of people die, not physically but mentally and now had even lost their soul. 
They have become like a zombie with no humanity and man kind. Now the people who dont give up on finding their purpose to life,
 they have to fight a lot against their comfort zone against their temporary fun. Its not like they never thought of giving up, they had 
thought many times to just giveup but they had already tained their mind first that</h2>
                    <h1>"GIVING UP IS NOT MY THING . I WILL FIGHT. I WILL NEVER GIVE UP ON THE THINGS I WANT".</h1>
                     <h2>To train your mind you need to contol your mind by contolling your feelings and emotions. Every human has their own different
meaning to life. Simply if you want to find what is life? then you have to find your meaning to live.</h2>
